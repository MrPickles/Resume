\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Google}
\descript{Software Engineer}
\hfill
\location{August 2017 – Present | Mountain View, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item
  Built risk-based re-authentication integrations into key Google flows,
  scanning over 400 queries-per-second of potential hijacker traffic.
\item
  Refactored re-auth proof token exchanging system to filter out untrusted
  devices as second factor challenge recipients and to opportunistically block
  risky users.
\item
  Consulted for and collaborated with
  teams looking to integrate with an authentication API, enabling LDAP as a
  service for G Suite customers and two-factor authentication in Google Cloud
  virtual machines.
\item
  Added support for sending Google Prompts to the iOS Gmail app during login,
  effectively tripling Google Prompt coverage for iOS users to 140 million
  users.
\item
  Conducted A/B tests and analyzed data on authentication UX and policies.
  Improved pass rate of Google Prompts by 10\%
  and overall success rate for Google sign-in by 5\%, through the aforementioned
  experiments.
\item
  Prototyped a new challenge where users could scan a QR code to approve a
  sign-in from a remote browser.
\item
  Migrated Google Authenticator's build system to Bazel and removed all of the
  app's internal dependencies. Currently in the process of releasing an open
  source version of the Android app.

\runsubsection{Dropbox}
\descript{Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
\location{May 2016 – Aug 2016 | San Francisco, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item
  Investigated and analyzed performance issues with Dropbox's Python web server.
  Fixed server inefficiencies, reducing the loading time of Dropbox's
  website homepage by 33\% as a result of the optimizations.
\item
  Implemented an end-to-end flow written with React.js and Python to let users
  request team upgrades to Dropbox Business. Integrated with an RPC service to
  send email campaigns to Dropbox team admins receiving upgrade requests.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Google}
\descript{Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
\location{May 2015 - Aug 2015 | Kirkland, WA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item
  Created an exploitability detection engine in Breakpad (an open source crash
  reporting suite written in C++) that predicted whether a binary
  crash occurred due to attacker exploitation by implementing triaging heuristics
  such as buffer overflow detection and binary permission checking.
\item
  Deployed the exploitability engine into Google's crash triaging pipeline,
  scanning all internal crashes of Google Compute Engine instances and Google
  Chrome for traces of exploitation.
\item
  Open sourced all internal changes to Breakpad for public usage and auditing.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{US Army Research Laboratory}
\descript{Security Research Intern}
\hfill
\location{May 2014 - Aug 2014 | Adelphi, MD}
\begin{tightemize}
\item
  Coauthored a research paper for the USENIX security conference in 2015,
  detailing the usage of code stylometry and machine learning as a means of
  authorship attribution for anonymous samples of source code.
\item
  Wrote a Python web crawler to scrape historical source code entries from
  programmers participating in the Google Code Jam programming competition.
  Cleaned up scraped source code for use as a corpus of training data.
\item
  Constructed features sets for source code by building a lexical analysis tool
  in Java to analyze common features present in source code samples.
